# SwiftFTR 0.8.0 Release Readiness (2025-11-20)

## Status
- Event-driven ping (DispatchSource/kqueue) is shipped; per-session ICMP identifiers validated in the parser.
- Network integration tests are serialized via `NetworkTestGate` to avoid cross-suite interference.
- Full test matrix currently green.

## Tests
- `PTR_SKIP_STUN=1 swift test -c debug --disable-sandbox` → PASS (122 tests)

## Documentation
- README updated for kqueue-based I/O and `Package.swift` example now targets `from: "0.8.0"`.
- CHANGELOG contains 0.8.0 entry (ping refactor, DNS API).
- BENCHMARKS.md includes 0.8.0 throughput/CPU/memory numbers.
- Regressions and mitigation notes tracked in `docs/development/0.8.0-ping-regressions.md`.

## Release-Blocking Items
- Run a release build sanity check: `swift build -c release` (optionally `-Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`).
- Regenerate docs if desired: `swift package --allow-writing-to-directory docc generate-documentation --target SwiftFTR --output-path docc --transform-for-static-hosting`.
- Draft/tag GitHub release notes summarizing the ping refactor, DNS API, and benchmark deltas.
- Restore `ResourceBenchmark` to run the throughput/CPU benchmark (currently doubles as an ICMP ID sanity check) and validate against BENCHMARKS.md on current hardware.
