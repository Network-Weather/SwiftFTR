  - `TraceClassifier.classify()` is now async

### Performance Improvements

  - Replaced `_ASNMemoryCache` class+NSLock with actor
  - Eliminated `@unchecked Sendable` patterns
  - Compiler-enforced thread safety throughout ASN resolution pipeline
  - No performance impact (safety improvement only)

### Testing

0.5.3 — 2025-10-04
------------------
### Bug Fixes
- **FIXED**: Ping operations now exit immediately when all responses received
  - Removed unconditional timeout sleep that delayed returns even when all packets arrived
  - Removed unnecessary +1s deadline buffer in receiver task
  - Significant performance improvement for multi-destination monitoring (e.g., hop-monitor)
  - PingParallelismTests completion spread: 2s → 63ms

### Code Quality
- Fixed linter warnings (line length, import ordering)
- Improved test code formatting

### Testing
- **ENHANCED**: Major test coverage improvements
  - Added comprehensive Bufferbloat test suite (16 structure tests, 2 integration tests)
  - Added STUN test suite (10 error handling tests, 5 network integration tests)
  - Coverage improvements: Bufferbloat 10.5% → 84.8% (+74.3%), STUN 61.5% → 63.3% (+1.8%)
  - Overall project coverage: 73.0% → 84.7% (+11.7%)
  - All network-dependent tests now conditional via `SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS` env var
  - CI skips network tests (fast, isolated), local runs include them (comprehensive)

0.5.2 — 2025-10-03
------------------
### Performance Improvements
- **FIXED**: `ping()` now runs in parallel, not serially
  - Changed `ping()` from actor-isolated to `nonisolated` method
  - Changed internal `PingExecutor` from actor to struct
  - **Performance**: 6.4x speedup for concurrent ping operations
  - Multiple concurrent `ping()` calls now execute truly in parallel
  - Before: 20 concurrent pings would take ~7.2s (serialized)
  - After: 20 concurrent pings take ~1.1s (parallel, 54ms spread)

### Testing
- Added `PingParallelismTests` demonstrating concurrent execution with high-RTT target
- Test: 20 concurrent pings to Tanzania (360ms RTT)
- Verifies completion spread <500ms for parallel operations
- All 45 tests passing

### Technical Details
- `PingExecutor` converted to struct (no mutable state, doesn't need actor isolation)
- Each ping operation creates its own socket for true independence
- `ResponseCollector` remains actor for thread-safe response handling
- No breaking changes to public API

0.5.1 — 2025-10-02
------------------
### Major Features

  - Video call impact assessment (jitter and latency thresholds)
  - Supports upload, download, and bidirectional load testing
  - CLI: `swift-ftr bufferbloat` subcommand with configurable duration and load type

### Implementation Details
- **Efficient single-session ping architecture**

  - Baseline phase: measures idle latency (default 5s)
  - Load phase: parallel TCP streams while measuring latency (default 10s)
  - Load generation: URLSession with 4 parallel upload/download streams
- **Test duration:** ~15 seconds (5s baseline + 10s load by default)

  - `ping()` method with `PingConfig`, `PingResult`, and `PingStatistics`
  - Single ping, multiple pings, or continuous monitoring workflows
  - Configurable count, interval, timeout, and payload size
  - Statistics: min/avg/max RTT, packet loss, standard deviation, jitter
  - CLI: `swift-ftr ping <host>` subcommand with `--count`, `--interval`, `--timeout`, `--json`
- **NEW**: Multipath discovery (Dublin Traceroute-style ECMP enumeration)
  - `discoverPaths()` method with `MultipathConfig` and `NetworkTopology` result

  - Utility methods: `uniqueHops()`, `commonPrefix()`, `divergencePoint()`
  - CLI: `swift-ftr multipath <host>` subcommand with `--flows`, `--max-paths`, `--early-stop`, `--json`

### Improvements
- **ENHANCED**: Flow identifier control for reproducible traces
  - Optional `flowID` parameter in `trace()` and `traceClassified()` methods
  - Stable flow identifiers enable consistent path discovery
  - Used internally by multipath discovery for ECMP enumeration

- **ICMP multipath may discover fewer paths than UDP-based tools**
  - Many ECMP routers do not hash ICMP ID field for load balancing
  - UDP-based tools vary destination port (5-tuple hashing)
  - Testing: ICMP found 1 path to 8.8.8.8, UDP (dublin-traceroute) found 7 paths
  - Use case: ICMP accurately reflects ping diversity, UDP reflects TCP/UDP app diversity
