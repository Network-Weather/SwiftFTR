# Hop Monitor

A demo CLI tool that continuously monitors all hops along a network path using SwiftFTR.

## Overview

`hop-monitor` performs a traceroute to discover the network path, then continuously pings all discovered hops at 1 ping per second per host, displaying live statistics including:

- **Last RTT**: Most recent round-trip time
- **p50**: Median latency (50th percentile)
- **p90**: 90th percentile latency
- **Packet Loss**: Percentage of lost pings
- **Jitter**: Average variation in latency between consecutive pings
- **Probes**: Total number of probes sent to each hop

## Usage

```bash
# Build the tool
swift build -c release --product hop-monitor

# Run it
.build/release/hop-monitor <destination>

# Example
.build/release/hop-monitor 1.1.1.1
.build/release/hop-monitor google.com
```

## Sample Output

```

## Features

- **Concurrent monitoring**: Each hop is pinged in parallel using Swift's structured concurrency
- **Live statistics**: Display refreshes every second with updated metrics
- **Percentile calculations**: Rolling window of last 100 samples for p50/p90
- **Jitter measurement**: Tracks latency variation between consecutive pings
- **Clean display**: Uses ANSI escape codes to refresh the terminal screen

## Implementation Details

- Uses `SwiftFTR` for traceroute and ping operations
- Actor-based statistics collection for thread-safe concurrent updates
- Maintains rolling window of RTT samples (last 100) for percentile calculations
- Jitter calculated as average of absolute differences between consecutive RTTs
- No STUN call needed (uses placeholder public IP for faster startup)

## Technical Notes

- **Ping rate**: 1 ping per second per hop
- **Sample window**: Last 100 RTT measurements
- **Concurrent execution**: All hops monitored in parallel
- **Display update**: Every 1 second
- **Traceroute limit**: 10 hops max (configurable in code)

## Use Cases

- **Network troubleshooting**: Identify which hop is causing latency or packet loss
- **Path monitoring**: Continuously track network path quality
- **Jitter analysis**: Detect unstable connections with high jitter
- **Comparative analysis**: Compare different routes or times of day

## Exit

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring and exit.
