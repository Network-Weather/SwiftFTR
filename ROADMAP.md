# SwiftFTR Roadmap

Forward-looking work, stack-ranked top-to-bottom by priority. For what has already shipped, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Priority Queue

### IPv6 Traceroute (ICMPv6)
**Goal**: Full feature parity for IPv6 networks.
- **Remaining work**: ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply, IPv6 traceroute with `IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS`, IPv6 STUN, IPv6 host-resolution path in `ping()` / `trace()` / probes (currently `AF_INET`-only).
- **Challenges**: Different socket options (`IPPROTO_ICMPV6`, `IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS`) and header structures compared to IPv4.
- **ASN data**: Bump `swift-ip2asn` floor to 0.4.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/Network-Weather/swift-ip2asn/releases/tag/v0.4.0)) — adds dual-stack `UltraCompactDatabase.lookup` (IPv4 + IPv6 binary search), bundled DB grows from ~3.5 MB to ~4 MB (~565K ranges, +119K IPv6). Ship the bump in the same release as the first IPv6 trace surface, so IPv6 ASN labels light up together with v6 hops — bumping standalone is pure carrying cost (~600 KB of dormant data).

### Enterprise Proxy & VPN Telemetry
**Goal**: Measure performance in locked-down corporate environments where direct internet access is blocked.
- **Proxy Tunneling**: Support HTTP CONNECT and SOCKS5 tunneling to reach external targets.
- **Segmented Timing**: Measure latency at each hop of the chain:
    1. VPN Ingress (time to reach VPN gateway).
    2. Proxy Access (time to TCP connect/handshake with the proxy).
    3. Target Access (time to TLS handshake with target *through* the tunnel).
- **Use Case**: Debugging "slowness" in corporate networks—is it the VPN, the Zscaler proxy, or the actual target?

### Enhanced Network Classification
**Goal**: Go beyond simple ASN labeling to identify sophisticated network types.
- **SASE/SSE**: Identify Zscaler, Netskope, and Prisma Access gateways.
- **Cloud/CDN**: Distinguish between AWS/GCP/Azure backbone transit and edge delivery nodes.
- **New Categories**: `.cdn`, `.cloud`, `.proxy`.

### System DNS Discovery (Split-DNS Aware)
**Goal**: Accurately identify the *effective* system DNS configuration, which is notoriously complex on macOS/iOS.
- **Problem**: Standard APIs (`res_ninit`) often return stale or incomplete data in complex VPN/Split-DNS scenarios.
- **Solution**: Deep interrogation of system resolver state (potentially using `SystemConfiguration` or patterns used by Chromium/Tailscale) to find the true resolver for a given domain.
- **Benefit**: Diagnostics that match the user's actual browsing experience, respecting enterprise split-tunnel DNS rules.

### QUIC & HTTP/3 Probing
**Goal**: Detect modern web infrastructure and test next-generation protocol support.
- **QUIC Handshake**: Send QUIC Initial packets (Version Negotiation) to detect HTTP/3 support without a full stack.
- **Use Cases**: Identify QUIC-capable CDN edges (Cloudflare, Google), test firewall QUIC filtering policies, and validate UDP/443 reachability.

### TCP Traceroute
**Goal**: Maximum firewall traversal capability.
- **Method**: Send TCP SYN packets with varying TTL to ports 80/443.
- **Use Case**: Discover paths through strict firewalls that block ICMP and UDP but allow web traffic.

### UDP Traceroute & Multipath
**Goal**: Match industry-standard tools (like `traceroute` and `dublin-traceroute`) that use UDP by default for better firewall traversal and ECMP visibility.
- **UDP Traceroute**: Send UDP probes with varying TTL. Handles ICMP Time Exceeded errors correctly.
- **UDP Multipath**: Leverage UDP port variation (5-tuple hashing) to discover ECMP paths that ICMP probes miss.
- **NAT Traversal**: UDP is often better at punching through NATs and firewalls than ICMP.
- **Implementation**: Requires raw sockets (`SOCK_RAW`) or experimental `IP_TTL` on connected UDP sockets. May require elevated privileges (sudo) or specific entitlements.
- **Reality check**: macOS sandbox restrictions make this harder than expected; TCP traceroute may be more practical.

## Future & Research

Ideas that are valuable but not yet scheduled.

### Advanced Analytics
- **Path Change Detection**: Alert when a route shifts (route flapping).
- **Jitter/Loss Analysis**: Per-hop quality metrics.
- **MTU Discovery**: Path MTU detection (PMTUD) without relying on ICMP Packet Too Big.

### Production Ready / Enterprise
- **Metrics Export**: OpenTelemetry or Prometheus exposition format.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Coordination format for running traces from multiple vantage points.
- **Linux Support**: First-class Linux support (handling capability requirements for raw sockets).

### Research
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection for latency spikes.
- **BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)**: Experiment with sending raw packets via `/dev/bpf` on macOS to bypass root requirements.
